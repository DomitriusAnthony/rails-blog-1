Introducing Code Tricks, a blogging site for sharing your coding secrets!

Currently deploying to heroku @ codetricks.herokuapp.com. Still ironing out bugs, so bear some patience.

Users can log in, sign up, edit account details, and delete their accounts using the navbar and user and post links throughout the site.

Users can also make new posts, and comment on posts throughout the site, as well as follow other users.

The site is created using Ruby on Rails, with Devise for authentication, and Bootstrap and Sass for styling.
